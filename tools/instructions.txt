Copy the sauth.sqlite file into this folder and run the python script as follows:

	python3 auth-convert.py

The script will create a new database file named out-auth.sqlite. How fast is it?
In testing it processed a db with 305,000 records in ~10 seconds.
Rename this file to sauth.sqlite to use with sauth v2.0 OR if you
want to migrate your data for use with the builtin auth handler
rename it auth.sqlite.

Remember to backup your original file before replacing it with the converted db!
